<h1>Our Story<h1>

<p>The story that Greenpeace tells is that a better world is possible, and that brave individual and collective action can make that world a reality.<br>
<h3>It's a positive vision, rooted in hope, and the conviction that when people in large numbers believe change is possible, change becomes possible.<br> We believe that when we take Nature as our model, mentor, and measure, we can change the way we feed and fuel our world.<br> 
We can live in harmony with the Earth and each other.
<p>We believe optimism is a form of courage. We believe that a billion acts of courage can spark a brighter tomorrow.<br></p>
<p>To that end we model courage, we champion courage, we share stories of courageous acts by our supporters and allies, we invite people out of their comfort zones to take courageous action with us, individually in their daily lives, and in community with others who share our commitment to a better world.<br></p>
<p>A green and peaceful future is our quest. The heroes of our story are all of us who believe that better world is not only within reach, but being built today.<br></p>
<p>The demons we must wrestle are the stories that are holding back a better world: that change is "impossible", "too expensive", "naive", "impractical." Stories that are rooted in apathy, cynicism, and despair and tell all of us we're too small, too few, too weak to change the world. We believe the story of the human journey is better than that. That it's rooted in courage, optimism, and creativity. That when people who believe in those things band together, when they stand up and take action together, their courage is compounded, it becomes contagious. Their voices are amplified, their stories ripple out to change the world.<br></p>
The old stories are failing us – the stories of infinite growth in a finite world. The stories that tell us we can consume our way to happiness.
<p>The world needs a new story – a story in which humanity overcomes seemingly impossible odds to not only survive, but to thrive. A story in which healthy, abundant oceans and forests heal a world powered by the natural forces that have powered life on Earth for billions of years. A world fed on a delicious bounty of life-giving food and pure water. A story in which the vast and powerful engine of human ingenuity is redirected toward building a more beautiful future for all.<br></p>
Be a part of that story.<br>
We dare you.<br></h3>
